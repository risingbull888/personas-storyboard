              <ul>
                  <li><b>What are your expectations for restaurant/cafe options?</b></li>
                  <ul>
                      <li>There should be the major brands of fast food chains and local popular stores</li>
                      <li>They should show stores within a deliverable and acceptable delivery time radius</li>
                      <li>They should not be more expensive than in store menus (Hidden Fees)</li>
                      <li>I should be able to quickly find similar types of restaurants in categories</li>
                  </ul>
                  <li><b>Has there been any user experiences that stand out as annoying or confusing?</b></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>I can never find the search bar</li>
                        <li>The UI has no customizability, I never use any options except for the restaurants and the other buttons take up so much space</li>
                        <li>I don‚Äôt know why clicking into my orders doesn‚Äôt let me view images of the food, and the rating system is very broken. I don‚Äôt think my comments actually make a difference</li>
                        <li>Some places you can slide right to exit the tab but some places you can only click the cross button to exit</li>
                    </ul>
                  <li><b>What frequency and purpose does delivered foods serve in your life? (e.g. daily/source of food, infrequent indulgences, induced by laziness etc.)</b></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>I usually order when I'm too lazy to cook, but I‚Äôm not really creative about my food choices</li>
                        <li>It is my fast food grabber, I usually order every week for my daily ‚Äòcheat day‚Äô, something like a McDonald‚Äôs or Popeyes‚Äô</li>
                        <li>I use it almost everyday to order coffee or other drinks, I don‚Äôt really have time to go wait in-person</li>
                    </ul>
                  <li><b>What is one thing that stands out in this application? (e.g. functionality, design)</b></li>
                  <ul>
                      <li>The minimalistic design and buttons really make the images of food stand out</li>
                      <li>All the scroll and buttons are very bouncy and responsive to extra scrolling</li>
                      <li>The clickable elements are usually very big</li>
                  </ul>
                  <li><b>If you could change one thing about the interface what would it be?</b></li>
                  <ul>
                      <li>The use of cartoon-like icons for the choices doesn‚Äôt get my appetite up, maybe have that shuffle pictures from my favorite restaurants</li>
                      <li>Everything is too big, there‚Äôs not enough information on my screen and makes it hard to compare different menu items</li>
                      <li>The black and white design has almost all buttons conform, maybe add themes for it to be more personalized and being able to customize/remove certain elements that I don‚Äôt use anyways</li>
                  </ul>
